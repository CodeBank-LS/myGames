A repository to store the games that developed with Unity
The first game is GyroRolling, which is a game in which the player uses a gyro device to control a floating platform to direct the ball to roll to its destination.
The game is ordinary in control method (as there are many similar games available), and it is my first game that utilizes Unity as the development tool, so I try to make it enjoyable with more features and animations when switching levels. The story line is inspired by "it takes two," which brings life content into the game.
Although the ball is controlled by the player, the ball itself is a character, it went through all the adventures and reached somewhere eventually.
